To act as a tutorial to teach people how to make a full,\r\n  complex, and multi-featured game inside of Unity (as opposed\r\n  to the more typical one-off, single-feature tutorials that\r\n  are more common).\r\n\r\n2. To provide a basic skeleton for any game that requires a\r\n  tile-based map with self-governing agents (i.e. characters)\r\n  as well as highly customizable objects (i.e. XML/Lua defined\r\n  furniture.)  To this end, we would be making a program themed as\r\n  a starbase-construction game -- though there's no reason that \r\n  someone couldn't produce something with a wildly different theme\r\n  or purpose (including not being a base-building game at all).\r\n\r\n**However, our true ultimate goal is to produce a community-developed\r\nbase building game in a similar style to Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld!**\r\n\r\nIf you want to watch the tutorials that cover the entirety of\r\ncreating this project from scratch, please visit:\r\n\r\n * <https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18creates/playlists>\r\n\r\nProject Porcupine was created by Martin \"quill18\" Glaude, whose work\r\nwas supported via Patreon:\r\n\r\n * <https://www.patreon.com/quill18creates>\r\n\r\n## Copyright & Licensing\r\n\r\nThe base project code is copyrighted by Martin \"quill18\" Glaude and\r\nis covered by multiple licenses.\r\n\r\nAll program code (i.e. C#, Lua, XML) is licensed under GPL v3.0 unless otherwise\r\nspecified.
